Multilevel Tokens - Scenes are made with stairs that should telepot players to the correct place in the corresponding scenes if all floors of a building are imported into game.

## Support Creation of Maps

I have started making these maps as I feel players deserve more than the line maps provided in many D&D 5e modules, and other settings. I intend to keep making and improving these maps in my free time, but if you want to support me in my costs to make these, please feel free to donate below:
